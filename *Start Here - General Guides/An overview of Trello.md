### Trello とは?

Trello is a free project management tool used by many WordPress.org teams to organise their contribution.
While every team has different approached, in this guide you will find basic instructions about the app to get you started.

Trello is based on Kanban boards, a way to show how work proceeds, with each column representing a stage of the overall process.
At the top level you have the organisation, then you have teams, boards and cards. 

### Signup

1. Sign up to Trello: https://trello.com/signup
2. Find the board of the team you would like to join. At the time of writing (March 2020), these are the available team boards:
   * [Community](https://trello.com/wpcommunityteam)
   * [Design](https://trello.com/b/fnHScayo/design-team)
   * [Documentation](https://trello.com/wordpressdocs)
   * [Marketing](https://trello.com/wordpressmarketing1)
   * [Theme Review](https://trello.com/b/proI6Fkp/wptrt-requirements)
   * [Training](https://trello.com/b/BsfzszRM/wordpress-training-team-lesson-plan-development)

For some boards, it’s enough to have a Trello account to leave comments on cards to ask questions or share insights. However in some cases, you might need to be added to the board by the owner.

You will also need to be added to boards to create or edit cards. You can ask to be added to a board in the team’s Slack channel or by contacting one of its Team Representatives: https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/

### An overview of Trello Cards

Click on a card to view its details.

There are three main sections you can see in any given card.

1. Main card information - includes: 
  * Title
  * Description
  * Members: depending how the board has been set up, some or all of the members will be displayed
  * Labels
  * Due date
  * Checklists
  * Attachments
2. Activity - includes comments on that card and active conversations between the team
3. Add attachment - area on the right of the card where documents, images and links can be added

### Collaborating with Trello

In any given card description, comment or checklist you can mention your fellow team members by using the @ sign followed by their Trello username. This is often used to add replies, assign tasks and to keep track of who is working on what.

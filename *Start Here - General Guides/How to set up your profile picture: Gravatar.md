# プロフィール写真の設定方法: Gravatar

Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar の略) は、Automattic が提供する無料のサービスです。 メール アカウントに画像を割り当てて、接続されたサービスの 1 つでそのメール アカウントを使用するたびに、プロファイル画像が表示されるようにすることができます。

すでに WordPress.com アカウントをお持ちの場合は、これを使用して gravatar.com にサインインできます。 プロフィール写真を追加するには、[写真とメールの追加] に移動します。

WordPress.com アカウントをまだお持ちでない場合は、以下の手順に従って Gravatar アカウントにサインアップしてください。

## Sign up for an account

1.  Go to [https://gravatar.com/](https://gravatar.com/)
    
2.  Click on the blue button ‘Create Your Own Gravatar’ and enter your details: Email address, Username, Password. Then click ‘Create Your Account’ to save your details.

3.  You will receive an email asking you to confirm your email address. The email will come from WordPress.com, not Gravatar. Please note that you won't be able to use Gravatar until you click on the link in that email.
    
4.  Click on the ‘Activate Account’ button in the email to finish the process.
    
5.  You will then be taken back to WordPress.com where you'll see a message thanking you for confirming your email and asking if you want to return to gravatar.com.
    
6.  Click the ‘Sign In to Gravatar’ button to do just that.

    If you want to change the picture associated with an email account, you will need to click on the email account, click on the picture and confirm you want to link them.
